## Dependencies

### Procedure
1. Copy the pinnFoam application into the pinnPotentialFoam application, rename it + compile it.
   - Rename the pinnFoam to pinnPotentialFoam.
   - Rename all pinnFoams in the code to pinnPotentialFoam. `grep -r pinnFoam`
2. Edit createFields.H and read the potientialFoam fields Phi and U.
3. Adapt the Neural Network (NN) `Psi(x,y,z,Phi)` to map a point in space `x =(x,y,z)` to the output vector `o=(Phi,ux, uy, uz)`, with `u=(ux, uy, uz)` being the potential-flow velocity, and \Phi the velocity-potential. 
4. Remove the existing PiNN residual MSE and train the NN as a Multilayer Perceptron on the Phi and U fields computed by OpenFOAMâ€™s potentialFoam solver.
5. Extend the NN into a PiNN for potential flow, by programming the potential-flow PDE residual 
    
    This means: 
   - Implementing the Laplace operator for .
   - Implementing the divergence operator for u.
   - Combining both into the residual MSE, and summing the residual MSE with the data MSE.


### Code Changes in OpenFOAM
According to the physics of the problem and solver, there has been changes made in different dictionaries.
### Optimization
Bayesian Optimization has been implemented to the solver.  
### How to use
Follow this procedure to run the code and see the results.

open the terminal and navigate _Cylinder_ testcase and execute the command below:

```bash
cd run/unit_box_domain/cylinder

./Allclean

./Allrun

pinnPotentialFoam

paraFoam

```

## Results
**CPU time** and **accuracy** of using the NN as the MLP without the PiNN residual and the PiNN approach for approximating Psi ,u is being compared.
