# OpenFOAM Machine Learning Hackathon

Welcome to the *OpenFOAM machine learning hackathon* repository! The hackathon is a community event organized by the [data-driven modeling special interest group](https://wiki.openfoam.com/Data_Driven_Modelling_Special_Interest_Group). If you are an OpenFOAM user excited about combining OpenFOAM and machine learning, this event is for you!

## How does it work?

A hackathon is an intensive get-together for creative problem solving in groups. The corner stones of the OpenFOAM-ML hackathon are as follows:

- **objective**: we prepare 2-3 exciting projects combining recent ML techniques and OpenFOAM; the projects are diverse; for each project, a fully-functioning starter code is provided; your task is to advance the starter code in a self-chosen direction; we provide you with a couple of potential ideas
- **time limit**: the hackathon consists of three full days of intense hacking
- **team work**: each participant chooses the preferred project/starter code; within each project, the participants are split up into groups of 2-5 people
- **workshops**: for each project, a workshop introduces the starter code and a necessary minimum of theory
- **hacking sessions**: the groups advance their projects; we aim to provide close mentor support for all groups via [gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) and [slack](https://slack.com/)
- **final presentation**: each team presents their final results to a jury of renowned OpenFOAM community members
- **evaluation**: the jury evaluates all projects according to the *evaluation criteria* listed below

The workshop is **fully virtual**. There is no geographical restriction for participants, but keep in mind that we cannot accommodate all time zones. The organizers' time zone is **CET**.

## Time line

- **May 15, 2022**: start of the application process
- **June 15, 2022**: end of the application process
- **July 1, 2022**: feedback on the applications
- **July 25-27, 2022**: hackathon

A detailed schedule for the hackathon will be provided two weeks prior to the event. Note that you should reserve **three full days** for the hackathon.

## How can I participate?

Since we aim to provide all participants with close support during the hackathon, the number of participants is limited to **20**. Applications are accepted until **June 15, 2022**. There are **no registration fees** or other costs, but admission is not guaranteed. Based on all applications, we will select the most suitable candidates.
